# Book API

This is my first step towards becoming a full-stack developer. As a frontend developer, I decided to move towards full-stack development by creating this Book API project. This project is built using ASP.NET Core Web API and MongoDB. 

I am extremely motivated to learn back-end development and get a chance to work for EXADEL, I am willing to 
devote 8 hours each day to learning this new branch of programming. <3
